Prowzi Core Agents - Specialized AI Agents for Autonomous Collaboration

This module defines the five core agents that power the Prowzi system:
1. ResearchAgent - Information gathering and fact verification
2. AnalystAgent - Data analysis and insights extraction
3. PlannerAgent - Strategic planning and task decomposition
4. ExecutorAgent - Implementation and execution
5. ValidatorAgent - Quality assurance and validation

Each agent is highly specialized and designed to collaborate autonomously
through the Magentic workflow orchestration.
