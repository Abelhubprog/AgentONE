"""
Advanced Magentic Multi-Agent Workflow - Autonomous Collaboration

This example demonstrates the most advanced orchestration pattern in Microsoft Agent
Framework: Magentic workflows with dynamic planning, autonomous agent collaboration,
and intelligent task delegation.

Key Features:
- Dynamic task decomposition and planning
- Autonomous agent selection based on expertise
- Self-organizing multi-agent collaboration
- Fact ledger for tracking progress and learnings
- Human-in-the-loop approval for critical decisions
- Checkpoint/resume capabilities for fault tolerance
- Real-time event streaming for observability

Production-Ready Patterns:
- Error recovery and retry logic
- Comprehensive logging and telemetry
- State persistence across runs
- Concurrent execution where possible
- Resource-aware scheduling

This is ideal for:
- Complex research and analysis tasks
- Multi-step problem solving
- Tasks requiring diverse expertise
- Long-running autonomous workflows
- Enterprise-grade AI orchestration
