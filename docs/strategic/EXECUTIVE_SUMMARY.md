7. **Begin Phase 1** - Start with codebase inventory and reality check

### Critical First Week
- Run test coverage analysis (pytest --cov)
- Execute static analysis (mypy, pylint, ruff)
- Perform load testing baseline (1, 10, 100 users)
- Audit MS Agent Framework usage patterns
- Identify dead code candidates (AST analysis)
- Calculate real completion percentage

---

## Why This Matters

### The "80% Complete" Problem
Many projects claim high completion rates while being far from production-ready. This analysis will:
- **Expose the truth**: Real completion likely 40-60% when measured properly
- **Define gaps**: Precisely what's missing for enterprise readiness
- **Create roadmap**: Clear path from current state to world-class product
- **Ensure success**: Avoid the trap of "almost done" for months/years

### The AgentONE Vision
We're not building another chatbot wrapper. We're creating:
- **The world's most intelligent autonomous research assistant**
- **10x faster** than manual research with higher quality
- **Verifiable sources** - no hallucinations, full citations
- **Publication-ready** output for academic and professional use
- **Self-improving** AI that learns from every research session
- **Transparent** process with real-time visibility
- **Enterprise-grade** security, scalability, and reliability
